# VGS Agent Toolkit

The VGS Agent provides examples for how to use VGS with popular agent frameworks, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) examples to integrate with VGS APIs through function calling.

## Examples

- [VGS Vault + Proxy MCP Server](examples/secure-data-mcp-example/)

## Best Practices

- Store client ID and client secret securely
- Implement token refresh logic to handle token expiration
- Use environment-specific tokens (sandbox for testing, production for real transactions)
- Avoid hardcoding tokens in application code
